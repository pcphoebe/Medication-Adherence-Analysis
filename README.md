# Healthcare & Economics: Medication Adherence Dataset Analysis

**Description**
This was an individual project for the Data Science Consulting class. The project focuses on adherence rates for three heart disease medications: ACE inhibitors,  beta blockers, and statins. Two datasets were given: baseline information on patients and adherence information on patients for when they refilled their medications. The report analyzes these information to identify insights and opportunities to increase adherence rates on these medications.
